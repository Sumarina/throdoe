1.  “A really good book costs $10 or $20 and can change your life in a meaningful way. It’s not something I believe in saving money on. This was even back when I was broke and I had no money. I always spent money on books. I never viewed that as an expense. That’s an investment to me. I probably spend 10 times as much money on books as I actually get through. In other words, for every $200 worth of books I buy, I actually end up making it through 10%. I’ll read $20 worth of books, but it’s still absolutely worth it.” ——Naval Ravikant
2.  The right book for the right person is not enough. It needs to be the right book, for the right person at the right time.
3.  sometimes you need to go on a little detour before you’re ready for what the book has to give you.
4.  The nice thing about books — they always wait where you leave them.
5.  No more putting it on my wishlist, buried with 200 other books until I forget why I got excited about it or who recommended it.
6.  If the book is getting a little boring, I’ll skip ahead. Sometimes I’ll start reading a book in the middle because some paragraph caught my eye and I’ll just continue from there, and I feel no obligation whatsoever to finish the book.——Naval Rvikant
7.  Reading because you want to, not because you feel you should.
8.  Life’s too short to endure books you don’t really enjoy. Read what you love, in the genres you love, from the authors you love.
